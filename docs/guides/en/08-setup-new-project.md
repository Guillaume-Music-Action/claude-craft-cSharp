## 1. Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

### Required

- [ ] **Terminal/Command Line** - Any terminal application
- [ ] **Node.js 16+** - Required for NPX installation
- [ ] **Git** - For version control
- [ ] **Claude Code** - The AI coding assistant

### Verify Your Prerequisites

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 16 or higher)
node --version
```
Expected output: `v16.x.x` or higher (e.g., `v20.10.0`)

```bash
# Check Git version
git --version
```
Expected output: `git version 2.x.x` (e.g., `git version 2.43.0`)

```bash
# Check Claude Code is installed
claude --version
```
Expected output: Version number (e.g., `1.0.x`)

### Install Missing Prerequisites

If any command above fails:

**Node.js:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use:
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

**Git:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) or use:
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git
```

**Claude Code:** Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code/installation)

---

## 2. Create Your Project Directory

Choose where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir ~/my-project

# Navigate into it
cd ~/my-project
```

**Verify:** Run `pwd` to confirm you're in the right directory:
```bash
pwd
```
Expected output: `/home/yourname/my-project` (or `/Users/yourname/my-project` on macOS)

---

## 3. Initialize Git Repository

Claude-Craft works best with Git-tracked projects:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init
```

Expected output:
```
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/yourname/my-project/.git/
```

**Verify:** Check that `.git` folder exists:
```bash
ls -la
```
You should see a `.git/` directory in the output.

---

## 4. Choose Your Technology Stack

Claude-Craft supports multiple technology stacks. Choose the one that matches your project:

| Stack | Best For | Command Flag |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Symfony** | PHP APIs, Web apps, Backend services | `--tech=symfony` |
| **Flutter** | Mobile apps (iOS/Android) | `--tech=flutter` |
| **Python** | APIs, Data services, ML backends | `--tech=python` |
| **React** | Web SPAs, Dashboards | `--tech=react` |
| **React Native** | Cross-platform mobile apps | `--tech=reactnative` |
| **Common only** | Any project (generic rules) | `--tech=common` |

**Choose your language:**

| Language | Flag |
|----------|------|
| English | `--lang=en` |
| French | `--lang=fr` |
| Spanish | `--lang=es` |
| German | `--lang=de` |
| Portuguese | `--lang=pt` |

---

## 5. Install Claude-Craft

You have two installation methods. Choose the one that fits your needs:

### Method A: NPX (No Clone Required)

**Best for:** Quick setup, first-time users, CI/CD pipelines

This method downloads and runs Claude-Craft directly without cloning the repository.

```bash
# Replace 'symfony' with your tech stack and 'en' with your language
npx @the-bearded-bear/claude-craft install ~/my-project --tech=symfony --lang=en
```

**Example for a French Flutter project:**
```bash
npx @the-bearded-bear/claude-craft install ~/my-project --tech=flutter --lang=fr
```

Expected output:
```
Installing Claude-Craft rules...
  ✓ Common rules installed
  ✓ Symfony rules installed
  ✓ Agents installed
  ✓ Commands installed
  ✓ Templates installed
  ✓ Checklists installed
  ✓ CLAUDE.md generated

Installation complete! Run 'claude' in your project directory to start.
```

**If you see an error:**
- `npm ERR! 404` → Check your internet connection
- `EACCES: permission denied` → Run with `sudo` or fix npm permissions
- `command not found: npx` → Install Node.js first

---

### Method B: Makefile (More Control)

**Best for:** Customization, contributing to Claude-Craft, offline use

This method requires cloning the Claude-Craft repository first.

#### Step B.1: Clone Claude-Craft

```bash
# Clone to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/TheBeardedBearSAS/claude-craft.git ~/claude-craft
```

Expected output:
```
Cloning into '/home/yourname/claude-craft'...
remote: Enumerating objects: XXX, done.
...
Resolving deltas: 100% (XXX/XXX), done.
```

#### Step B.2: Run Installation

```bash
# Navigate to Claude-Craft directory
cd ~/claude-craft

# Install rules to your project
# Replace 'symfony' with your tech and 'en' with your language
make install-symfony TARGET=~/my-project LANG=en
```

**Examples for other stacks:**
```bash
# Flutter in French
make install-flutter TARGET=~/my-project LANG=fr

# React in Spanish
make install-react TARGET=~/my-project LANG=es

# Python in German
make install-python TARGET=~/my-project LANG=de

# Common rules only (any project)
make install-common TARGET=~/my-project LANG=en
```

Expected output:
```
Installing Symfony rules to /home/yourname/my-project...
  Creating .claude directory...
  Copying rules... done
  Copying agents... done
  Copying commands... done
  Copying templates... done
  Copying checklists... done
  Generating CLAUDE.md... done

Installation complete!
```

---

## 6. Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything is in place:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/my-project

# List the .claude directory
ls -la .claude/
```

Expected output:
```
total XX
drwxr-xr-x  8 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user user 2048 Jan 12 10:00 CLAUDE.md
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 agents
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 checklists
drwxr-xr-x  4 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 commands
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 rules
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Jan 12 10:00 templates
```

### Verify Each Component

```bash
# Count rules (should be 15-25 depending on stack)
ls .claude/rules/*.md | wc -l

# Count agents (should be 5-12)
ls .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l

# Count commands (should have subdirectories)
ls .claude/commands/
```

**If files are missing:**
- Re-run the installation command
- Check that you have write permissions to the directory
- See [Troubleshooting](#10-troubleshooting) section

---

## 7. Configure Project Context

The most important file to customize is your project context. This tells Claude about YOUR specific project.

### Open the Project Context File

```bash
# Open in your editor (replace 'nano' with 'code', 'vim', etc.)
nano .claude/rules/00-project-context.md
```

### Sections to Customize

Find and update these sections:

```markdown
## Project Overview
- **Name**: [Your project name]
- **Description**: [What does your project do?]
- **Type**: [API / Web App / Mobile App / CLI / Library]

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: [e.g., Symfony 7.0, Flutter 3.16]
- **Language Version**: [e.g., PHP 8.3, Dart 3.2]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL 16, MySQL 8]

## Team Conventions
- **Coding Style**: [e.g., PSR-12, Effective Dart]
- **Branch Strategy**: [e.g., GitFlow, Trunk-based]
- **Commit Format**: [e.g., Conventional Commits]

## Project-Specific Rules
- [Add any custom rules for your project]
```

### Example: E-commerce API

```markdown
## Project Overview
- **Name**: ShopAPI
- **Description**: RESTful API for e-commerce platform
- **Type**: API

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Symfony 7.0 with API Platform
- **Language Version**: PHP 8.3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16

## Team Conventions
- **Coding Style**: PSR-12
- **Branch Strategy**: GitFlow
- **Commit Format**: Conventional Commits

## Project-Specific Rules
- All prices must be stored in cents (integer)
- Use UUID v7 for all entity identifiers
- Soft delete required for all entities
```

Save the file when done (in nano: `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).

---

## 8. First Launch with Claude Code

Now let's start Claude Code and verify everything works:

```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory
cd ~/my-project

# Launch Claude Code
claude
```

You should see Claude Code start with a prompt.

### Test That Rules Are Active

Type this message to Claude:

```
What rules and guidelines are you following for this project?
```

Claude should respond mentioning:
- Project context from `00-project-context.md`
- Architecture rules
- Testing requirements
- Technology-specific guidelines

**If Claude doesn't mention your rules:**
- Make sure you're in the project directory (not a subdirectory)
- Check that `.claude/` directory exists
- Restart Claude Code

---

## 9. Test Your Setup

Run these quick tests to verify everything works:

### Test 1: Check Available Commands

Ask Claude:
```
List all available slash commands for this project
```

Expected: Claude should list commands like `/common:analyze-feature`, `/{tech}:generate-crud`, etc.

### Test 2: Use an Agent

Try invoking an agent:
```
@tdd-coach Help me understand how to write tests for this project
```

Expected: Claude should respond as the TDD Coach agent with testing guidance.

### Test 3: Run a Command

Try a simple command:
```
/common:pre-commit-check
```

Expected: Claude should run a pre-commit quality check (may report no changes if project is empty).

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Claude Code starts without errors
- [ ] Claude mentions project rules when asked
- [ ] Slash commands are recognized
- [ ] Agents respond with specialized knowledge
- [ ] Project context is reflected in responses

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem:** `Permission denied` during installation
```bash
# Solution 1: Fix directory permissions
chmod 755 ~/my-project

# Solution 2: Run with sudo (not recommended for npm)
sudo npx @the-bearded-bear/claude-craft install ...
```

**Problem:** `Command not found: npx`
```bash
# Solution: Install Node.js
brew install node  # macOS
sudo apt install nodejs npm  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

**Problem:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory`
```bash
# Solution: Create the target directory first
mkdir -p ~/my-project
```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem:** Claude doesn't see the rules
- Verify you're in the project root: `pwd`
- Check `.claude/` exists: `ls -la .claude/`
- Restart Claude Code: exit and run `claude` again

**Problem:** Commands not recognized
- Check commands directory: `ls .claude/commands/`
- Verify file permissions: `ls -la .claude/commands/*.md`

**Problem:** Agents not responding
- Check agents directory: `ls .claude/agents/`
- Use correct syntax: `@agent-name message`
